# Cuisine Cycle

This project was developed during HackThisFall, a hackathon aimed at Innovating for good Our project focuses on reducing food waste by providing users with recipes based on the ingredients they have available.

## Problem Statement

Food waste is a significant issue contributing to environmental degradation and global hunger. Our goal is to tackle this problem by empowering users to make the most of their ingredients and reduce food waste at home.

## Solution Overview

Our app allows users to input the ingredients they have on hand, and it suggests recipes that utilize those ingredients. By providing creative and practical recipe ideas, we aim to encourage users to use up ingredients they already have, ultimately reducing food waste.

## Features

- **Ingredient-Based Recipe Search**: Users can input ingredients and receive recipe suggestions.
- **Detailed Recipe Information**: Each recipe page provides detailed instructions, cooking time, and serving size.
- **User Authentication**: Registered users can create accounts and log in to access additional features.
